# SOM-ORTHANC

This is a Docker image configured to run [orthanc](http://book.orthanc-server.com/users/docker.html) with a simple postgres database. I've provided complete instructions in [scripts/setup_instance.sh](scripts/setup_instance.sh) to configure a new Ubuntu 16.04 machine to run Docker and docker-compose, and in the future this will be a start up script for any general machine started with [Packer](https://packer.io). But you can also just install Docker and docker-compose locally, and give it a test! To use, you will need to install Docker and docker-compose. Then:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/som/som-orthanc.git
cd som-orthanc
```
You probably want to change the configuration file username and password for the database, it's in [orthanc/orthanc.json](orthanc/orthanc.json). Then bring up the image.

```
docker-compose up -d
```
You are going to see:

```
WARNING: Image for service orthanc was built because it did not already exist. To rebuild this image you must use `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up --build`.
```
and that's fine, it's because we are being a bit lazy in having it build for us instead of building it in advance. You could do that too:

```
docker-compose build
```

ports 104 and 80 should connect to Orthanc, so you should be able to open [http://localhost](http://localhost) to see things. Note that we are using the web server (nginx) installed on the host, which doesn't have to be the case (we could use a docker image).

How do you see your images? Like this:

```
docker-compose ps
docker ps
```

You will probably want to shell into the image to look around. I usually do this (note that I got the name from the `ps` commands above:

```
NAME=$(docker ps -aqf "name=somorthanc_orthanc_1")
docker exec -it $NAME bash
```

The `i` means interactive, and the `t` means terminal. So you are asking to run `bash` via an interactive terminal.

# Uploading Dicom
I found I could just drag and drop files on the web interface, even my janky cookie dicoms seemed to work ok :) It should be located at [http://localhost/app/explorer.html#upload](http://localhost/app/explorer.html#upload).

And this is how you would use (for example, storescu) to upload files:

```
storescu -aec SOMORTHANC localhost 4242 *.dcm
```

Since you probably don't have this installed on your computer, you can use the dcmtk Singularity / Docker images that I've generated. Both are provided, and can be run with [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov) if in an environment without sudo, or with Docker on your local machine. Since we are working with Docker here, I'll show you how to use [the image provided on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/dicom/), and I've also written up a complete (nicer to look at) walkthrough for both as part of the [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/containers-dcmtk) organization containers docs.

Here is how to see the general command usage, with `--help`:

```
docker run --volume /path/on/host/*.dcm:/data vanessa/dicom storescu --help
```

and here is how you could map a folder locally into the container with dicoms, and use storescu to send files there:

```
docker run --volume /path/on/host/*.dcm:/data vanessa/dicom storescu -aec SOMORTHANC localhost 4242 /data/*.dcm
```

Before I get this up and running in some cloudy place, I'm going to look more into the authentication and other plugins that we might want.

# Storage
The image uses an actual folder on the filesystem, which seems similar to MIRC-CTP's approach. In this instance, I found it here, along with the configuration file:

```
ls etc/orthanc
OrthancStorage orthanc.json
```

and you can tell this from the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), but there are other database stuffs (eg postgres) here:

```
ls /var/lib/orthanc/db
ls /var/lib/postgresql
```

# Build
The original build files I found by way of looking at the [base Docker Image](https://github.com/jodogne/OrthancDocker/blob/master/orthanc/Dockerfile). They are located at `/root` in the image.

```
root@b0ec09719511:/# ls /root
build-dicomweb.sh    build-webviewer.sh  build.sh
build-postgresql.sh  build-wsi.sh
```

And unfortunately the /root/orthanc folder (with additional scripts and resources) is removed during the [original build](https://github.com/jodogne/OrthancDocker/blob/master/orthanc/build.sh)! I cloned the original repo with mercurial, re-obtained the files (stored in [orthanc/resources](orthanc/resources) and these are added to the image. I was very happy to see that these scripts are all in Python :)


# Things to Learn!
Importantly, OrthanC has a [RESTful API](http://book.orthanc-server.com/users/rest.html) to interact with it, which looks like it will do most of what we need (although I need to test for myself). Backup can be done with [postgres](http://book.orthanc-server.com/users/backup.html), and I also know how to set up what Google calls [hot standby](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/setting-up-postgres-hot-standby) to back that up.

# Plugins
The application seems to be focused around plugins, which I found here:

```
ls /usr/share/orthanc/plugins/
libOrthancDicomWeb.so           libOrthancWSI.so
libOrthancPostgreSQLIndex.so    libOrthancWebViewer.so
libOrthancPostgreSQLStorage.so
```

I also found some command line executables:

```
$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ ls
OrthancRecoverCompressedFile  OrthancWSIDicomToTiff  OrthancWSIDicomizer
```

## OrthancRecoverCompressedFile

```
OrthancRecoverCompressedFile       
Maintenance tool to recover a DICOM file that was compressed by Orthanc.

Usage: OrthancRecoverCompressedFile <input> [output]

```

## OrthancWSIDicomToTiff
This is pretty neat, it seems to be a tool to convert dicoms to tiff, likely it's used for the web viewer.

###  OrthancWSIDicomizer

A few notes from this [list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/orthanc-users/RO4XKCxDEAE) on how to scale.

>> Regarding Swarm, you'll have to adapt this to a Docker "stack" file; 
the format is mostly compatible with docker-compose and may eventually 
supplant it. You have to pay attention to persistent volumes however, 
which you don't want spread across nodes mindlessly. Leads: consider 
using a distributed filesystem for Orthanc storage, or a key/value 
store with associated plugin, or even a Postgres database with 
"EnableStorage": "true". For the index, only use one replica and 
consider things like CloudStor or other solutions that will ensure the 
data is always where the container is running (or accessible from 
there). PG also has built-in replication capabilities to explore. 

I suggest starting small, though scaling does get interesting ;). 
Stateless services are usually easy to work with, especially with a 
solution like Swarm or K8s, but state is often a little bit of a 
challenge.
